            <h4 class="text-center">Background</h4>
            <p>The Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) wants to improve the situation of foreign exchange students coming to UPM. Therefore, they plan on creating a new web page to assist these new students in settling in Madrid. <br />
Our task was to create two different prototypes focussing on two different usability criteria (which we had to decide on along the process). Before creating the prototypes we conducted interviews and specified the context of use. Next, we created different layout schemes and navigation maps for each prototype. Then we designed two low-fidelity prototypes (one with pen and paper, one with Balsamiq) and lastly extended them to two high-fidelity prototypes (one with Axure RP, one with Adobe XD).<br />
I am going to focus mostly on the first prototype (pen and paper, Axure RP) because I was responsible for its design.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">The Process</h4>
            <p>The idea was developed in a brainstorming and ideation class as part of our Innovation and Entrepreneurship minor. Before we started to go deeper into the topic, Stanley Kelder and I took part in the HackForGood hackathon in Madrid. We used the hackathon to further develop and discuss the idea and to create a first quick prototype. See our presentation of the hackathon in the video below (which was edited with just 15 minutes time).<br />
<br />
To create the business model we first conducted some interviews with potential customers and experts in the fields of blockchain and fair supply chains. Then, we performed market research, made a SWOT analysis and a competition analysis. Step by step, we developed the business model that way, iteratively improving the model and conducting more in-depth research. Furthermore, we laid out a financial plan based on our sales projection, defined milestones and created a market entry strategy.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Executiv Summary</h4>
            <p><strong>Product</strong><br />
An online clothing platform, where the complete supply chain for each piece of clothing is saved in a blockchain and made visible. Every company can offer their products and show their supply chain to increase their customer trust and reach.<br />
<br />
<strong>Market</strong><br />
Sustainable/ethical products are highly trending in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, UK and the USA. Furthermore, people are willing to spend significantly more for these products than for non-sustainable ones.<br />
<br />
<strong>Strategy and Finances</strong><br />
First six months: Development of the platform and getting the first companies to partner with us, focussing on Germany and the Netherlands. We will pay the 10.000€ needed for that by ourselves.<br />
<br />
Next 12 months: Selling t-shirts of our platform to festivals, to promote the platform, create the first income and use the time to get more companies onto the platform. We will also publish the app and make our platform for everyone available. We will need a 100.000€ investment for this.<br />
<br />
Next 18 months: A year after the publication, we will expand to the UK and the USA, to increase the customer reach. For the expansion, another 500.000€ are needed.<br />
<br />
Long-term endeavor: Become a universal online platform like Amazon, but for sustainable and transparent products.<br />
<br />
<strong>Management</strong><br />
Our team has expertise in blockchain technology, user experience, marketing, innovation and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, we have profound connections with experts working on fair supply chains.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">My Learnings</h4>
            <p><p>Different people can have very different problems, especially different from mine.</p>

<p>When conducting interviews, in the beginning, our interviewees reported very different issues they had encountered when they came to Madrid relative to mine. For me, it was clear, that the biggest problems would be applying for the NIE (a Spanish ID card) and finding a room. However, many interviewees didn&rsquo;t report these issues, but others that were completely unexpected for me, such as finding the way to the university and knowing where to buy which products. So I realized I had to step back and open up to their problems, even if it would mean that my issues would not be solved.</p>
