            <h4 class="text-center">Background</h4>
            <p>The Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) wants to improve the situation of foreign exchange students coming to UPM. Therefore, they plan on creating a new web page to assist these new students in settling in Madrid. <br />
Our task was to create two different prototypes focussing on two different usability criteria (which we had to decide on along the process). Before creating the prototypes we conducted interviews and specified the context of use. Next, we created different layout schemes and navigation maps for each prototype. Then we designed two low-fidelity prototypes (one with pen and paper, one with Balsamiq) and lastly extended them to two high-fidelity prototypes (one with Axure RP, one with Adobe XD).<br />
I am going to focus mostly on the first prototype (pen and paper, Axure RP) because I was responsible for its design.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Observation Planning and Interviews</h4>
            <p>Before conducting the interviews, we put some thought on who, where, how, when, what, and why to perform the interview. Most importantly to answer the &ldquo;What?&rdquo;, we decided on asking the interviewees the following questions (and more): <br />
<br />
- What kind of tasks did you have to do when you arrived in Madrid? <br />
- What were the first things you did for the university?<br />
- What kind of difficulties did you have when coming to UPM/Madrid as a foreign incoming student? <br />
- How was the first time arriving at the campus? <br />
- Did you have any help doing your tasks? If so describe them. <br />
<br />
Afterward, we conducted interviews with eight foreign students of the UPM, most of which were our fellow students. After we had collected all the data, we proceeded with the next step.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="pt-4 col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 order-md-2">
            <h4 class="text-center">Analysing the Context of Use</h4>
            <p>Based on the information gathered in the interview, we create a user profile, a persona, and a task organization model. We decided that learnability and efficiency are the most important usability criteria since most of the tasks only need to be performed/learned once and are something students just want to get done with quickly. Therefore, the Axure prototype was focussed on learnability and the Adobe XD prototype on efficiency.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we identified the tasks of finding a place to live and finding the way to the university as most crucial for foreign students, because these need to happen at the very start. Based on these tasks, we created two task scenarios.<br />
<br />
For creating the prototypes and the subsequent testing we defined the tasks with specific input data, so that the prototypes could be adjusted to them:<br />
<br />
1. Find and open the best website for renting a room according to the following criteria. It should be in a ​shared flat​, in a ​lively district​, ​visiting the room before renting ​is desired, and most importantly it is ​cheap​ and ​secure. <br />
<br />
2. Find the best connection to the ​UPM Montegancedo​ campus with the exact bus station using the user’s ​current location​.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Low-Fidelity Design</h4>
            <p>The usability criteria that we focused for this prototype was learnability. For that reason, the navigation map was designed in order to guide the user step by step to achieve the task. You can see the implemented screens highlighted in blue. <br />
<br />
With learnability in mind, we designed this prototype with a more guided navigation. The first page has a simple layout displaying all five categories of tasks users can complete/get help with through our website. The categories have icons, so the right category can be found quicker without having to read/process all the text. The user chooses one of the categories to then choose the specific task he wants to complete in page two (and five).<br />
<br />
We made sure the layout would be both externally and internally consistent, so users would understand its structure quicker. Furthermore, we included breadcumbs, so users would not get lost on the website when going through all the steps.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">High-Fidelity Design</h4>
            <p>The use of graphics and pictures was a priority for us in this prototype, so users could understand the different sections based not only on (English) text. Every section is well distributed around the screen, to have a clear layout and avoid possible distractions. The general design has many similarities to the one found on the UPM.es website. This decision was made to create a consistent online appearance of UPM. This can increase the learnability of all websites since users that have used any of the similar UPM websites before might already have created a good mental model about how the websites work and therefore should also find it easier to navigate through our website.<br />
<br />
However, at some points, we did not agree with the UPM.es design decisions and therefore broke out of the given design. Our header-menu is actually included in the header and not below it. We found that the way the header-menu is designed on the UPM.es website can easily make users confuse it with breadcrumbs. Additionally, the UPM.es website is generally quite static and plain, which can make it sometimes a little difficult for users to understand the layout and with which widgets they can interact or where to click. Consequently, we implemented clear visual feedback for the areas that can be clicked by making use of material design. When hovering over any of the categories at the frontpage, for example, the whole panel raises up (indicated by a shadow), showing the user that by clicking anywhere on the panel, he will get to that content. <br />
<br />
We felt the UPM.es website was too crowded, therefore we tried the create more space between the elements which, again, increases the learnability of the website and assures that users do not feel overwhelmed. We used orange and/or different (rounded) shapes for those elements where we wanted to emphasize their difference to other elements. For example, the drag and drop feature in the preferences page has orange color and rounded corners.<br />
<br />
Another important feature we made use of is mapping. In the result page of the find housing section, for example, we mapped the districts shown on the map to the elements in the accordion-list. Users can hover over the elements and the elements mapped to it will highlight in orange. This way users can easily and intuitively figure out which entry belongs to which area. A similar idea has been used for the “Plan your journey” map.</p>

            <p><p>Different people can have very different problems, especially different from mine.</p>

<p>When conducting interviews, in the beginning, our interviewees reported very different issues they had encountered when they came to Madrid relative to mine. For me, it was clear, that the biggest problems would be applying for the NIE (a Spanish ID card) and finding a room. However, many interviewees didn&rsquo;t report these issues, but others that were completely unexpected for me, such as finding the way to the university and knowing where to buy which products. So I realized I had to step back and open up to their problems, even if it would mean that my issues would not be solved.</p>
